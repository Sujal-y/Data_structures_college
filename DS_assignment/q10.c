//Consider a social network represented as an undirected graph where individuals are nodes and a friendship between
//two individuals is an edge. You are tasked with analyzing this network to understand connectivity and influence.
// Question:
// Given the following social network graph:
// Code
// Nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G Edges: (A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (C, E), (D, F), (E, G), (F, G)
// Illustrate the traversal order of both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from node 'A'.
// Clearly indicate the data structure used (Queue for BFS, Stack or Recursion for DFS) and the state of the data
// structure at each major step of the traversal.
